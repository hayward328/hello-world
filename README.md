The classic Hello World Programming Repository

My name is Hayward Little, and I am a native Detroiter, Waddupdoe!

My elementary school, K - 8, was St. Benedict in Highland Park, MI.  I attended the University of Detroit Jesuit High School (Detroit, MI) from 9 - 12 and then pursued my Computer Science degree at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University (Greensboro, NC).  After working for the Information Technology Management department at DaimlerChrysler, I accepted a buyout to pursuse my entrepreneurial dreams.  During those years, I found time to receive my MBA from Baker College (Flint, MI) and have had plenty of fun and wild rides with various businesses over the years.

I am looking to brush off my Jedi Knight programming skills and look to create some awesome tools and apps.  I'm excited to be part of the GitHub Community and look forward to what AWESOMENESS will happen!
